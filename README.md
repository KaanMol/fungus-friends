# The reason this project exists

For a job interview I was asked to make a small project. I was given a list of requirements. I decided to make a small web app that shows a map with mushrooms. The mushrooms can be filtered by color and spots. The mushrooms are fetched from an api. The web app is made with React. The map is rendered with leaflet. The project is hosted on Github Pages and can be found [here](https://kaanmol.github.io/fungus-friends/).
